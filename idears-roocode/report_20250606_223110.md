## Tasks Summary

## 1. Code Assessment

### Command executed:
```bash
pnpx repomix --ignore "node_modules" --stdout | run-prompt code/high-level-review-consise | tee assessment-consise.md
```

**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

### Assessment Output:
```markdown
[claude-3.7-sonnet] Running prompt: /Users/wschenk/prompt-library/code/high-level-review-consise.md
The "Idears" application is a well-structured prototype with clean code organization, good test coverage, and proper separation of concerns, though it lacks critical production features like authentication, secure file handling, and proper database storage. I would rate this developer an 8/10 as they demonstrate strong fundamentals, test-driven development practices, and containerization knowledge, suggesting they could readily address the identified limitations with appropriate guidance.
```

## 2. Docker Image Build

### Command executed:
```bash
docker build -t idears-roocode .
```

**Status:** ⚠️ SKIPPED (no Dockerfile)
